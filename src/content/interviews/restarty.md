We talked about:
- Why I chose to study computer science in Slovakia
- Experiences I gained working at different companies
- Not being afraid to ask more experienced colleagues for help
- Why remote work suits me
- How I stay connected with other developers
- Focusing on improving one thing at a time (not everything at once)

**Resources and tools I recommend (back in 2023):**
- medium.com — personalized articles
- dev.to — developer community, articles, podcasts, videos, etc.
- daily.dev — browser extension with personalized dev articles
- GitHub Copilot — trending AI tool that boosts productivity
- ChatGPT — great for work, general questions, and even fun
- Yuval Noah Harari's trilogy: Sapiens, Homo Deus, and 21 Lessons for the 21st Century — must reads
- No link for this one, but I believe discipline, self-education, and believing in the best are the keys to personal success
