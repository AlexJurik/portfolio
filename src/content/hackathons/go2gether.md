"Hi, my name is Alex and my colleague is Matúš ([Matus Stedl](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matus-stedl-487613124/)) and we are founders of the brand new Go2gether application...".

With these words started a presentation of a product we managed to build in 24 hours on the Hackathon hosted by T-systems Slovakia corporation. We participated in the challenge from Košice 2.0 and tried to make more effective, comfortable and safe a situation on the roads in our beautiful city.

Just imagine how many drivers are driving with an empty car. I am having minimum two rides every day alone. We were trying to group the people with a close starting position, close destination and close time windows. If the user plans a route our intelligent algorithm is able to detect if there is anyone who is driving pretty much the same route (not just comparing latitude and longitude points) and offer these users to contact each other and Go2gether!

Tech stack is Angular with Ionic + Capacitor. Database is surely mocked as we wanted to focus on the complete user flow to sell our idea. Also we used Mapbox APIs to calculate Isochrones for starting and end positions of the route.

Even if we didn't win the challenge we are really proud of our solution. We provided a complete MVP product with a roadmap (in presentation), where features which could be implemented are shown.
